# CarParts
This Python project implements a flexible system for creating custom vehicles using a combination of design patterns. Users can configure and build various types of vehicles (cars, trucks, etc.) with a wide range of specifications, including color, engine, and equipment..


Key Features:

Extensive customization: Users can tailor their vehicles with a variety of options, such as different engine types, colors, and accessories.
Diverse vehicle types: Supports the creation of various vehicle types, including cars, trucks, and more.
Cloning existing vehicles: Users can create copies of existing vehicles and modify them to suit their specific needs.
Implementation of design patterns:
Singleton: For managing a centralized database of vehicle components.
Factory Method: For creating different types of vehicle components.
Abstract Factory: For creating families of related components.
Builder: For constructing vehicles step-by-step.
Prototype: For cloning existing vehicles.
Modular structure: The project is designed with a modular structure for easy maintenance and expansion.
Comprehensive testing: Unit and integration tests ensure the system's reliability.
Project Structure:

Main file: Contains the core logic of the application, including classes for vehicles, components, factories, and builders.
Database file: Stores information about vehicle components and configurations.
Test file: Contains unit and integration tests to verify the system's functionality.
Usage:

Install dependencies: Install the required dependencies to run the project.
Run the application: Execute the application and configure your desired vehicle through the user interface or command line.
Create vehicle: The system will automatically create your vehicle based on the selected configuration.
Technologies:

Programming language: Python
Design patterns: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype
Target audience:
